 * Alignment-independent fuzzy fingerprint for ECU ROM files.
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Uses **one-permutation MinHash with bucketing** over byte-level
 * Karp-Rabin rolling-hash shingles:
 *
 *  1. Slide an n-byte shingle across every byte position of the ROM.
 *     The shingle hash is updated in O(1) per byte via the Karp-Rabin
 *     recurrence, so the whole file is hashed in O(N).
 *  2. For each shingle's hash h, compute bucket = h mod K.  In the
 *     bucket, keep only the SMALLEST hash seen so far.
 *  3. The fingerprint is the K-element vector of per-bucket minima.
 *
 * Why this beats the previous (bottom-K window) approach:
 *
 *   * **Position-independent.**  Two ROMs that share identical content
 *     but at different file offsets (e.g. raw `.bin` vs `.ols` inner
 *     ROM extracted with an 80-byte container header) produce
 *     overlapping shingles regardless of alignment.  Our previous
 *     fixed-stride 4 KB / 256 B-step windowing failed at this:
 *     a 76-byte shift dropped match% to zero.
 *
 *   * **Discriminative.**  Bucketing splits the hash space into K
 *     independent slots.  A bucket's minimum reflects content WITHIN
 *     that slot, not the globally-rarest hash.  Two unrelated ROMs
 *     from the same family no longer collide on shared rare patterns
 *     (vector tables, `0x00` padding) — they only match where they
 *     share specific byte content.
 *
 * Jaccard similarity is estimated as the fraction of buckets where
 * both fingerprints have an identical hash:
 *
 *     J(A, B)  ≈  count(i : A.sig[i] == B.sig[i] != 0)
 *                 ────────────────────────────────────────
 *                 count(i : A.sig[i] != 0 ∧ B.sig[i] != 0)
 *
 * For K = 128 the standard error on Jaccard is ≈ 1/√K ≈ 8 %.
 *
 * **Storage**: 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 128·8 + 128·8 ≈ 2 KB per file.  500k
 * fingerprints fit in ~1 GB on disk.
 *
 * **Note on `.ols` containers**: the indexer extracts the inner ROM
 * via OlsImporter before fingerprinting.  For multi-version `.ols`
 * (Original + Stage 1 + …), the stored fingerprint is the per-bucket
 * MIN over all versions — i.e. a sketch of the union of all versions'
 * shingles.  This makes the file match if ANY of its versions is
 * similar to the needle.
 *
 * **Stage 2 verification** (separate module): for top-N hits from this
 * sketch screen, the candidate is reopened, aligned to the needle by
 * byte search, and an exact byte-identity is computed over the
 * overlapping range — and over each map region declared in the .ols.
 * That gives WinOLS-grade "% Project" / "% Data area" precision.
